here are collected of studies on the rippling affects of porn consumption on individuals and societies as a whole


- Pornography addiction: a neuroscience perspective: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050060/) “yet there is a tendency to trivialize the possible social and biological effects of pornography. The sex industry has successfully characterized any objection to pornography as being from the religious/moral perspective; they then dismiss these objections as First Amendment infringements. If pornography addiction is viewed objectively, evidence indicates that it does indeed cause harm in humans with regard to pair bonding.[2] The correlation (85%) between viewing child pornography and participating in actual sexual relations with children was demonstrated by Bourke and Hernandez.[4] The difficulty in objective peer-reviewed discussion of this topic is again illustrated by the attempted suppression of this data on social grounds.[15] The recent meta-analysis by Hald et al. strongly supports and clarifies previous data demonstrating correlation with regard to pornography inducing violence attitudes against women.[10] With such strong correlative data, it is irresponsible not to address the likely possibility of causation in these regards. Reviewing this data in the context of current usage patterns is particularly concerning; 87% of college age men view pornography, 50% weekly and 20 daily or every other day, with 31% of women viewing as well.[5] The predictive effect of pornography on sexual behavior in adolescents has also been demonstrated.[6]”
- Porn is addictive, and just like other addictions, people develop a tolerance to it and seek out more extreme, thrilling or perverse forms of it to achieve the same high (https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-affects-the-brain-like-a-drug/).
- Men who view porn are significantly less likely to intervene as a bystander, report an increased behavioral intent to rape, and are more likely to believe rape myths
(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720162.2011.625552?journalCode=usac20#tabModule)
- Men are at high risk of engaging in forced sexual behavior when their use of pornographic material has instilled and reinforced attitudes involving women as sex objects. Messages in sexually explicit material are more powerful than lessons from family and society, indicating that frequent use of pornographic material tends to taint appropriate moral and social development (https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/pornography-and-the-violent-offender-importance-of-finding-the-offenders-pornography-stash-2157-7145.1000229.php?aid=26630).
- Porn linked to reoffending in child molesters (http://www.knesset.gov.il/committees/heb/material/data/H09-06-2010_13-44-46_maamar1.pdf) “Both observational learning and conditioning processes suggest that repeated exposure to deviant forms of pornography, given the focus on male entitlement and power, help shape an individual’s fantasies, perceptions, rationalizations, and deeper core beliefs.”
Around 100 women in Japan were lured to a fake sleep study then drugged and raped, their rapes were recorded and sold on porn sites (https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/06/asia/japan-rape-porn-arrest/index.html) (also note the similarity between this and the recent spycam issue in hotels and bathrooms in South Korea)
Porn actress Niki Benz sues MindGeek, Brazzers, co-stars for sexual battery, gender violence. During the on-screen ‘‘exit’‘ interviews, used to show porn stars consented to everything, she told the truth and said no, and was forced to re-record it with a positive answer or threatened not to be paid.
Young, Female and Addicted to Porn: The impact of porn on men has been studied, but little is known about how it could affect women (https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/9b21d1b8-7d4a-4022-a79a-2c5030b70e72)
Teen is the most commonly searched porn term (https://flowingdata.com/2013/09/03/most-popular-porn-searches-by-state/)

2015 study found a link between porn consumption and physical and verbal sexual aggression (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcom.12201).
88% and nearly 50% of the best-selling porn shows physical and verbal aggression towards women (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801210382866)
2010 study on popular porn films: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801210382866 88% of scenes contained physical aggression, including spanking, gagging, and slapping. Women were overwhelmingly the targets of aggressive acts, and men the perpetrators.
Following instances of aggression towards women, in 95% of cases the women expressed pleasure or neutrality.
Pornography Online Is Driving ‘Horrific’ Crimes, Says Top Judge (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11373046/Pornography-online-is-driving-horrific-crimes-says-top-judge.html)
Porn is used to train sex slaves (http://www.cwfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CWA_Pornography-and-SexTrafficking.pdf).
Porn is integral to prostitution (http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/FarleyRentinganOrgan11-06.pdf) “49% reported that pornography was made of them while in prostitution. 47% reported being upset by a customer’s insistence to perform an act previously seen in pornography. A similar study found 52% of prostitutes reported that pornography played a significant role in teaching what was expected of them as prostitutes.”
The demand for porn fuels the demand for sex trafficking (https://www.covenanteyes.com/2011/09/07/the-connections-between-pornography-and-sex-trafficking/).
About half of sex trafficking survivors report porn was made of them when they were in bondage (https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-fuels-sex-trafficking/).
A study in 2010 suggests a link between porn consumption and rape-supportive attitudes in men (http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf).
